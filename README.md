# OpenEdx-Installation-Problem-on-VMWARE
We are installing open edx on a Virtual Machine (32-bit Ubuntu Host) with IP say 10.0.X.X (say). In course of installation we have successfully installed a virtualbox which has created an another IP 192.168.33.1 on my vmware. Now the virtualbox is up and running however when I try vagrant reload, i am not able to proceed with ssh to 127.0.0.1.
